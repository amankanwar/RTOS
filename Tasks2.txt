Question:
          Write following application
          Use cooperative scheduling algorithm 

          (No Delay Used)
          Task1 (Priority 1)  -> Toggle LED 1
                              -> Yeild CPU using yeild call

          (No Delay Used)                
          Task2 (Priority 1)  -> Toggle LED 2 
                              -> Yeild CPU using yeild call
